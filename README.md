# ShooterGame
It is a basic beginner project in javascript. A two player shooting game in which players take alternative turns. Players have full health(100) 
in the beginning of the round. when a player chooses a number between 1 to 5, the health of the other player decreases by that number.
The first one to reach 0 health loses. There are 5 rounds and the player that wins the maximum rounds, wins the game.
